# Dependency Injection
Go has implicit interfaces, which enable easier dependency injection. This is a toy server to practice a _"concrete implementation"_ of these concepts.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to this repo
2. Run `go run main.go` in a terminal window
3. Open up another terminal process and use a curl request - e.g. `curl http://localhost:8080/hello\?user_id\=2`
